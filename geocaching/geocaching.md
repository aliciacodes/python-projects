#	Instructions 



You have recently decided to get into <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching">geocaching!</a> You load up the app on your phone and find the location of your first cache. 



1. You want to keep track of how many miles you are traveling while you are geocaching. Create a variable called `cache_distance` 

   to track how far you travel and set it to zero.

   

2. Looks like the first cache is 2 miles away! Assign the value 2 to the variable `distance_from_home`.

   

3.  Add `distance_from_home`to the variable `cache_distance` . 

   

4. After a lot of walking and looking, you find the capsule with an empty logbook. Make a variable called `empty_logbook` and assign it to an empty string.

   

5. Now, you want to add your signature catchphrase to the logbook. Make a variable called `signature_catchphrase` and assign it to this string: 

   "How you doin'?"



6. Let's official put it in the books! Add your `signature_catchphrase` to the `empty_logbook` variable.



7. Before you go, you want to add one more quote. Make a variable called quote and assign it to this string:

"I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude." 



8. Add the `quote` to the  `empty_logbook` variable.



9. It's time to go home. Add `distance_from_home` to `cache_distance`.



10. Now, you're an expert geocacher and want to make a cache that's even closer to your house. So, you go onto the geocache store and create an account to start buying some gear. Create a variable called `customer_total` and assign it to 0. 

    

11. You find a bird geocaching container you can use. To add it to your cart, create a variable called `birdhouse_container` and assign it to the value to 9.99.

    

12. Before you checkout, you find a trendy baseball cap. Make a variable called `geocache_cap` and assign it to the value 25.00.

    

13. It's time to checkout! Add the value of `birdhouse_container` to the `customer_total`.

    

14. Now add the value of `geocache_cap` to `customer_total`

    

15. Before you can pay, you need to calculate sales tax. We will assume the sales tax is 5% or 0.05. Assign the variable `sales_tax ` to 0.05.

    

16. Now multiply the `sales_tax ` by the `customer_total` and assign it to `customer_tax`

    

17. Add `customer_tax` to `customer_total`

    

18. Almost done! Print the string "Customer Invoice".

    

19. Now print out the `customer_total`

    

20. Congrats you're done and ready to go on your next geocaching adventure!
